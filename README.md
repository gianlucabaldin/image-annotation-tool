# Annotation tools

This projet is a playground to work with html canvas: it shows a single canvas with an image as background and a toolbar on the right side.
You can draw rectangles and circles on the canvas and give them a label: a shape with a label is called an "annotation".
Once drawn, you have the possibility to select the annotations, too.

You can save the current session by clicking on the "save" button, which will automatically restore it in case of a page refresh or closure of the tab/browser. You can also delete it using its corresponding button.
